Windows checks permissions at the time of the open (aka handle request) but not afterwards. Windows allows you to duplicate a handle and hand it off to another thread or process which then inherits whatever level of access the first program obtained to the object when the program opened. Therefore a thread impersonating a different user or a process running as a different user could exploit the potentially higher level of access of the first program for that object. And that apparently is why this event is logged. Unfortunately this event doesn't seem to provide enough information to determine if the Handle was given to a lower security thread or process. Consequently I classify this event as noise.\n\r\nFor an explanation of the fields in this event see events 4688 and 4656.\n\r\nDo you know more about this event?

This phenomenon is caused by the way the Server service terminates idle connections. \n\r\nIf a user turns off his/her computer, Windows does not have an opportunity to log the logoff event until the system restarts. Therefore, some logoff events are logged much later than the time at which they actually occur. \n\r\nSometimes Windows simply doesn't log event 538. \n\r\nMicrosoft's comments: \n\r\nThis event does not necessarily indicate the time that a user has stopped using a system.

Write Property and Read Property accesses will be followed by the actual properties written to or read. \n\r\nObject types and property names can be cryptic.
